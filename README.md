ðŸ’¡ In this class, the students can learn the basics of manipulating industrial robot arms (EPSON robot) operation. The class introduces two types of robots 6-Axis robots. The main subjects include Introduction to Industrial Robot Arm, Software and Simulation, Calibration and Alignment, I/O port Communication, Human-machine interface (HMI), and Machine vision. Ultimately, the students can design an automatic work cell with the robot.

ðŸš© Basic and Challenging tasks
The suggested basic tasks can help students familiarize the setting of the World, Local, and Tool coordinates with the robots and utilize essential functions and commands. The challenging tasks provide ideas and drill exercises for students to improve their coding and planning skills. These tasks only depicted the targets (specification or functionality) without detailed instructions. Students should use their creativity to leverage the functions and commands they learned in the lectures and robot manuals.

Basic tasks
Task 1. Exploring the robot envelop and the work cell:
Install tools and components (feeder, fixture, tray) and explore their coordinates with tools (extra parts may be required to proceed the calibration)
